Ruleset order matters, so the picker keeps your chosen order (Cribl applies them in order and the first match wins). You can also bulk-set the Event Breaker buffer timeout. Only Source types that support Event Breakers can be selected; the rest are shown disabled with the reason. Dry run is on by default, and every change is previewed as a before/after diff before anything is written. Committing and deploying the group are opt-in.',
